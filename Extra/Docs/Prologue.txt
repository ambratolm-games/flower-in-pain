In a land of magnificent splendor, 

far beyond the boundaries of civilization, 

a powerful kingdom stood in the heart of Asia. 

Ruled by a benevolent king, 

peace and prosperity were plentiful until the king 

passed away after a long battle with illness, 

leaving the throne to his only daughter, 

a wise and beautiful princess.

As the kingdom celebrated her ascension, 

the princess fell in love with her cousin, 

Prince Foluck, 

and together they vowed to wed. 

But just as a year had passed, 

the princess found herself pregnant with a child.

And, after a difficult labor, 

fell into a deep slumber.

When she awoke, 

the princess found herself in 

a strange and unfamiliar place, 

far from the comfort of her bedchamber. 

Puzzled and disoriented, 

she realized that she was trapped, 

with no idea how or why she had come to be there. 

Fear and confusion gripped her as she thought of 

her newborn child, her husband, and her kingdom,

all now a mystery to her in this strange new world.

With only her wits to guide her, 

the princess began her treacherous journey 

through the enigmatic labyrinth. 

The path ahead was riddled with complex puzzles, 

each with its own secrets and dangers.

Can she emerge triumphant ?

or will the maze's secrets consume her forever? 

Only time will tell.
